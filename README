Intro
=====
This code is a port of JITES from DOS to Linux to be able to simulate situations based on the actual code having been used during Belgian elections 2014.

Election test
=============
Current tables represent the european election at Saint-Vith - Eupen
You can compare it to the official simulation: http://elections2014.belgium.be/simElec/index.php?lang=DE-FR&ins=63023&screen=lang&step=0&elector=1

Differences with real software
==============================
* AFTER YOUR VOTE THE "CARD" WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE READ BACK SO YOU CAN VISUALIZE YOUR VOTE
* config with TST_EL2014 -> no password required to start the machine
* no light pen, use mouse instead
* no reset button
* X11 fonts slightly smaller
* candidate selection by pixel painting was too slow, we only paint its number

DEMO:
=====
Current demo.gif shows:
* selection of SP head
* delesection of SP head
* back to lists
* selection of Ecolo head
* confirmation of vote for Ecolo
* ejection of the card
* introduction of the card for vote visualization

Reading back the card shows recorded vote is for SP list (but no preference or head vote registered)
Ooops

Note that the inverse does not lead to the same result:
* selection of Ecolo head
* delesection of Ecolo head
* back to lists
* selection of SP head
* confirmation of vote for SP

Reading back the card shows recorded vote is for SP list (and head vote registered)

So lists are not equally facing the bug!
