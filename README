Election test
=============
Current tables represent the european election at Saint-Vith - Eupen
You can compare it to http://elections2014.belgium.be/simElec/index.php?lang=DE-FR&ins=63023&screen=lang&step=0&elector=1

Differences with real software
==============================
* config with TST_EL2014 -> no password to start the machine
* no light pen, use mouse
* no reset button
* X11 fonts slightly smaller
* candidate selection by pixel painting was too slow, we only paint its number

DEMO:
=====
demo.gif has been recorded as animated gif with
byzanz-record -c -x 3 -y 22 -w 640 -h 480 tmp.gif
to compress the result:
gifsicle -k3 --optimize tmp.gif > demo.gif

It shows:
* selection of SP head
* delesection of SP head
* back to lists
* selection of Ecolo head
* reading back the card shows SP list (but nothing selected)
